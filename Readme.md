Hand gesture-based control of Video Player using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
In this project, convolutional neural network of 5 layers is trained for recognizing 4 classes of hand-gestures direction. These classes are - Next, Previous, Pause, Play.

**1.** Without Media player integration
 ```sh
 python test.py
 ```
**2.** With media player integration (requires few media .mp3 files in the current directory)
```sh
python vlctest.py
